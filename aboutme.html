        <p>
            Welcome to my About Me Page! My name is Angelina Biafore and I'm a 19 year old college freshman! I've lived in Rhode Island all my life I go to URI now! Prior to this class have had little to no programming or coding practice. I mainly got interested in computer science because my mom teaches it at her high school and I used to love doing code.org practice in middle school. I'm currently a bio major but I'm thinking of changing my major into something like computer science or business. Some of my favorite things to do include swimming, paddleboarding, rock climbing and skiing! I also love travelling and one of my biggest goals is to visit all the national parks and make a scrapbook of pictures from each one, but I haven't been to any yet! I want to try to live outside the US at some point in my life or study abroad just to try different sceneries and be able to get more experiences!
