            Welcome to my About Me Page! My name is Angelina Biafore and I'm a 20 year old college sophomore! I've lived in Rhode Island all my life but now I go to FAU! Prior to my javascript class, I had little to no programming or coding practice. I mainly got interested in computer science because my mom teaches it at her high school and I used to love doing code.org practice in middle school. I'm currently a computer science major and am taking a programming in C class. Some of my favorite things to do include swimming, paddleboarding, rock climbing and skiing! I also love travelling and one of my biggest goals is to visit all the national parks and make a scrapbook of pictures from each one, but I haven't been to any yet! At some point I would love to live somewhere different in the US.
